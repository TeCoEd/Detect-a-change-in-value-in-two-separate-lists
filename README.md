# Detect-a-change-in-value-in-two-separate-lists
Detect  change in two separate lists, change either value from a 1 or 0 and the program will identify if the value went 'on' or 'off'.  Edit the two lists at the top of the program:

device_status = [1,0,0] 

device_status2 = [0,0,1]

Run the code and the program will print out which values have changed.
